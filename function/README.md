  -  Given two sets A, B, we call f : A $\rightarrow$ B is a function, so we have $`S_f \subseteq A \times B \text{ satisfying for each } a \in A, \text{ there exists } b \in B \text{ uniquely such that } (a, b) \in S_f`$. We call A as the domain, B as the codomain, $`Imf = \{ b = f(a) | a \in A \}`$ as the image of f or the range of f.
