## Terms

<details><summary>Proposition</summary>
  
  - A sentence or statement which has a definite truth value[^truth_value_def].
  
  - ex. 1 = 2 (false), 1 = 1(true)
    
</details>

<details><summary>Formula</summary>

  - A proposition which has variables upon whose it's truth value depends.
    
  - ex. Given a formula $`x^2 + y = 5`$, which is true when (x, y) = (1, 4), (2, 1)⋯, but false when (2, 2), (4, 1)⋯.

</details>

<details><summary>Conjunction</summary>

  - Given two propositions P and Q, conjunction is a operation which creates new proposition whose truth value is true only when both P, Q are true.
